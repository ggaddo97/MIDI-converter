# MIDI-converter
MIDI filter which aloows to read and write I/O MIDI signals
Simple filter of MIDI signals, created for MAC OS, using a virtual MIDI interface from
internal MIDI manage program.
It's possible to create a Real Time look-up table for MIDI signal.
Useful for old MIDI interfaces (like YAMAHA MIDI drum) with a not updated MIDI mapping,
that a lot of program, nowdays, can't read.
